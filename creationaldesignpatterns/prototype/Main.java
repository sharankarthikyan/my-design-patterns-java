/*
 * Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy 
 * existing objects without making your code dependent on their 
 * classes.
 * 
 * Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend 
 * on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
 * 
 * Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of 
 * subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize 
 * their respective objects. Somebody could have created 
 * these subclasses to be able to create objects with a 
 * specific configuration.
